# RetroBus Explorer

RetroBus Explorer is an FPGA-based platform designed to capture, analyze, and visualize signals from legacy 5V system buses. It uses a specialized level-shifting interface board for bus compatibility, streams the captured data through an F600 FTDI chip, and presents live waveforms, decoded protocols, and analytics via a JavaScript (WebUSB) interface in the browser.
